        <p>
          Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, harassment, defamation, doxxing, sexual
          depictions of children, and conduct promoting alt-right and fascist ideologies will not be
          tolerated.{' '}
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances

        <h3>2.4 Responsibilities of users and contributors</h3>
        <p>
          Users and contributors are responsible for watching out for any unacceptable behaviour or
          content, such as harassment, and bringing it to moderators&apos; attention by using the{' '}

            MoodleNet Tracker
          </a>{' '}
          for MoodleNet Central or by contacting the instance administrator.
        </p>
        <h3>
          2.5 Responsibilities of the project maintainers (such as instance operators, community
          moderators, and Moodle HQ)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Project maintainers, including instance operators and community moderators, given the
          relevant access, are responsible for monitoring and acting on flagged content and other
          user reports, and have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
          communities, collections, resources, images, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
          contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to suspend or ban -
          temporarily or permanently - any contributor for breaking these terms, or for other
          behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instance operators should ensure that every community hosted on the instance is properly
          moderated according to the Code of Conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour
          and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
          unacceptable behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moodle HQ does not wish to be deemed the arbiter of truth and will only intervene when
          there is an unresolved dispute.
        </p>
        <h3>2.6 Enforcement</h3>
        <p>
          All complaints must, in the first instance, be reviewed and investigated by project
          maintainers, who must provide a response within a reasonable time following such complaint
          that is deemed necessary and appropriate in the circumstances. Project maintainers are
          obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
          details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may
          face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other maintainers of the
          project.
