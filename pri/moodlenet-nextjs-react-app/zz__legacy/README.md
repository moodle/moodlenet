In the future we will be supporting a federated search across all instances.

## Current Status

MoodleNet 4.0 now features AI metadata generation for resources, gamification to vastly improve how quality is identified and surfaced to you as a user.

## Documentation

Our main documentation with everything you need to know is here: [MoodleNet Docs](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/MoodleNet).

## Quick install tip

The easiest way to install and update your own instance is via NPM:
